                        <p class="description_main">Organizations try to defend themselves from today’s most serious risk: the hacker attacks. 
                            These attacks may cause data leakage, business interruption and serious reputational losses as well. Protection 
                            against this risk must be layered: sole technical solutions like intrusion detection/protection tools are not enough 
                            and organizations must eliminate the basis of the hacker attacks: the system and software vulnerabilities. Nearly 
                            all hacker attacks are based on the unpatched vulnerabilities. The vulnerability assessment is a first step for 
                            organizations to discover the starting points of successful hacker attacks. This service can be partially automated 
                            by professional software tools and some parts must be manually executed by security professionals. Based on the results, 
                            the organization needs to manage the patching of the vulnerabilities in order to have a healthy, updated and secure 
                            environment. Having fixed the problems, a penetration testing is necessary to check whether there are still vulnerabilities 
                            or misconfigurations in the system. The main target of the vulnerability assessment is discovering all relevant, hackable 
                            problems in the system, whereas the penetration test should be a proof whether the system is still vulnerable or not.</p>

                            identify security vulnerabilities that could be exploited. The primary objective for security as a whole is to prevent unauthorized 
                            parties from accessing, changing, or exploiting a network or system. It aims to do what a bad actor would do.</p>
                        <p class="description_main">Penetration testing simulates a real cyber-attack with the purpose of testing an environment’s cybersecurity posture. 
                            At its most basic, a successful pen test will prove how genuine the vulnerabilities in your infrastructure may be by determining if a threat actor can get 
                            through.Our penetration testing goes much further than a typical vulnerability scan, utilising advanced manual techniques to further 
                            investigate and eliminate the false positives that are common within an automated scan. Our security consultants follow OWASP and OSSTMM 
                            penetration testing methodologies to exploit vulnerabilities . In addition to the checks and analysis, which are defined in OWASP, 
                            additional checks in accordance with newest trends and techniques are performed to deliver the most extensive pentest service possible.</p>

                            <p>The number of web apps and websites is growing rapidly, many providing easy access to sensitive user or financial data, 
                                making them a highly prized target for cybercriminals.</p>
                            <p>A web application penetration test, looks for any security issues that might have arisen as a result of insecure development, 
                                design or coding, to identify potential vulnerabilities in your websites and web applications, including CRM, extranets 
                                and internally developed programmes - which could lead to exposure of personal data, credit card information etc.</p>

                            <p>Physical penetration testing prevents hackers from gaining tangible access to systems and servers by ensuring that facilities 
                                are impenetrable by unauthorized personnel. IT and cybersecurity professionals focus primarily on system vulnerabilities 
                                and may overlook aspects of physical security that can result in exploitation. Physical penetration tests focus on attempts 
                                to gain access to facilities and hardware through RFID systems, door entry systems and keypads, employee or vendor impersonation, 
                                and evasion of motion and light sensors.</p>

                            <h4>Cloud Penetration Testing</h4>
                            <p>Cloud services are essential for group collaboration, networking, and storage. Large amounts of data is stored within the cloud, 
                                which means that it is a hotbed for hackers seeking to exploit this technology. Cloud deployment is relatively simple. However, 
                                cloud providers often have a shared or hands-off approach to cybersecurity, and organizations are responsible for vulnerabilities 
                                testing or hacking prevention themselves. Cloud penetration testing is a complicated test, but one that is necessary and important.</p>
